Hey there, in case you're new here, my name is Newton and I'm a Rails Developer.  

This site is aimed at addressing the documentation gaps highlighted by fellow members of the Rails community.
Here you'll find **how-to guides** and **deep dive** posts about most of the newish libraries in the Rails Ecosystem such as:
1. **Hotwire/Turbo**
2. **Stimulus**
3. **Kamal**

Ocassionally, I'll also write about some of my learnings contributing to [open source](https://github.com/zhephyn) as this has been my focus this year. 

Adios! and Thanks for passing by.
